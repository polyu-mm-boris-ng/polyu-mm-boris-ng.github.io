The uprising of FinTech is associated with a critical challenge - cybersecurity. Many security applications, such as two-factor authentication (2FA), were developed to secure online transactions and mobile payments. Such technologies always offer good security, but many users are unaware of it. For this reason, individuals’ weak and insufficient security awareness will be a big vulnerability in FinTech development. In this regard, one stream of my research examines how to enhance individuals’ cybersecurity awareness and motivate them to take action against cybersecurity threats. My studies enrich the current research on fear appeal and provide a pathway to improve its design to persuade individuals to take cybersecurity precautions.
