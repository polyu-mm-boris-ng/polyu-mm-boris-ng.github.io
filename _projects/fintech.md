FinTech, RegTech, and LegalTech are deeply intertwined, forming the foundational pillars of Hong Kong’s transformation into a global financial hub. My research undertakes a comprehensive examination of these three fields, with the aim of providing valuable insights for academia, industry, and governmental bodies.

Allow me to shed light on my current focal areas and interests.

In the FinTech realm, my work revolves around four main themes:

1\.	Exploring the behavioral aspects of cybersecurity, <br>
2\.	Investigating the impact of DeFi hacks and exploits on the evolution of DeFi platforms,<br>
3\.	Assessing the influence of robo-advisors on investor performance and societal implications, and<br>
4\.	Utilizing machine learning to analyze FinTech talent growth through social media data.

In the sphere of RegTech, my research is geared towards:

1\.	Enhancing e-KYC procedures through the application of language style migration and speech recognition, and<br>
2\.	Integrating federated learning into statistical methodologies for more effective policymaking.

Turning to LegalTech, I am currently engaged in the development of an AI-based tool for processing Chinese legal documents. This tool leverages machine learning, natural language processing, and a set of expertly crafted rules to facilitate its functionality. My involvement with this tool led to my participation in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) Startup Postdoc Programme 2022, a program designed to cultivate research-based entrepreneurship. My project received recognition in the form of a HK$120,000 grant from the Micro Fund 2022-23 Cohort 2 and was selected for the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks (HKSTP) Pre-incubation Programme (IDEATION). Building on this momentum, I took the initiative to establish an academic-led startup named “Legalbotic Technology Limited.”

Through these research endeavors, I am striving to contribute to our understanding and advancement of these critical areas in the context of Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem.
