FinTech, RegTech, and LegalTech are intertwined and serve as the crucial underpinnings of the development of Hong Kong into a global financial center. My research thoroughly investigates various aspects of these three areas and makes efforts to offer implications for academia, industry, and government.

Here I will outline my current focuses and interests. Regarding the FinTech aspect, I am working on (1) advancing the behavioral aspects of cybersecurity, (2) understanding how DeFi hacks and exploits affect the development of DeFi platforms, (3) examining the impact of robo-advisor on investors’ performance and society, and (4) analyzing the FinTech talent growth using social media data with the machine learning approach. 

Regarding the RegTech aspect, I am working on (1) applying language style migration and speech recognition in improving e-KYC and (2) incorporating federated learning into statistical methods for better policymaking. 

Regarding the LegalTech aspect, I am working on developing an AI-based Chinese legal document processing tool using machine learning, NLP, and expert-crafted rules.
