### Research Interests

**Keywords: Responsible, Multimodal, Behavioral Analysis in Artificial Intelligence (R.M.B x AI)**

#### Overview
My research intersects at the confluence of **responsibility, multimodality, and behavioral analysis (R.M.B) within the domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.  I am dedicated to advancing our understanding of AI systems through the lens of ethical frameworks, multimodal data integration, and behavioral insights.

#### Methods

- **Data Analytics**: Employ advanced techniques in machine learning and data science to analyze complex multimodal datasets. i.e.: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Statistical Network Modeling, etc.

- **Empirical Research**: Conduct studies that test hypotheses in real-world settings, ensuring the ecological validity of findings. i.e.: Field/Lab Experiment, Econometrics, Survey, Structural Equation Modeling.

#### Objectives
The core aim of my research is to leverage real-world multimodal information to demystify and predict the behavior of three primary subjects:

- **AI Systems**: Unpacking the "black box" to understand decision-making processes and outcomes.
- **Customers**: Decoding patterns and preferences in user interaction with AI technologies.
- **Organizations**: Assessing the impact of AI adoption on business processes and culture.

#### Research Goals

- **To Enhance Responsibility in AI**: Develop methodologies that ensure AI systems are designed and deployed with ethical considerations at the forefront, promoting fairness, accountability, and transparency.

- **To Harness Multimodal Data**: Utilize diverse data streams (e.g., visual, textual, auditory, and sensory) to gain a holistic view of AI interactions and performance across various contexts.

- **To Understand Behavioral Dynamics**: Analyze the interplay between human and AI behaviors, with a focus on customer engagement and organizational change, to inform user-centric design and policy-making.

#### Expected Contributions

- **Academic**: Provide empirical evidence and theoretical frameworks that support the creation of responsible and effective AI systems, contributing to the scholarly discourse on AI ethics and behavior.

- **Practical**: Offer actionable insights for the development of next-generation AI systems that are attuned to the nuanced needs of users and organizations.

- **Regulatory**: Inform policy-makers with data-driven analyses that shape regulation and governance of AI technologies, ensuring societal welfare and technological advancement are aligned.

#### Summary

My research seeks to construct a supportive scaffold for the future of AI, one that is firmly rooted in responsible practices, enriched by diverse data, and guided by a nuanced comprehension of behavioral intricacies.  Through this, I aspire to contribute to the creation of AI systems that are not only intelligent but also equitable, usable, and benevolent. -->
