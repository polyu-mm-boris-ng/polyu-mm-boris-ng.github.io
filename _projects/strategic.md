Machine learning is widely used for decision-making in many business contexts. Although machine learning has been well recognized for identifying meaningful patterns from massive data, they are vulnerable to input manipulation, as agents may strategically behave or manipulate their characteristics to obtain the desired inference from machine learning models. Therefore, one stream of my research works on solutions to address this problem. Specifically, my ongoing works propose a human-AI hybrid approach that utilizes the complementarity of human knowledge and AI to improve the information processing of firm disclosures. In this context, adversarial behaviors can be observed as managers strategically adjust language and information content to mitigate unfavorable investor perceptions.
