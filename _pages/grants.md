<strong>Project Abstract:</strong>

Deceptive information captures increasing attention worldwide and severely impacts our society, especially during serious social, political, and epidemiological crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. More importantly, the spread of deceptive information on social media will severely hinder the promotion of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI). For instance, diversity is prohibited as fake content and misinformation facilitates the tendency for people to believe a piece of news that confirms their prior beliefs (Kim and Dennis 2019, Kim et al. 2019) or to only engage with like-minded people that polarizes the society (Del Vicario et al. 2016). Equity is harmed by harassment and sexual taunts that intensify gender bias and the hate speeches and discriminating messages that promote racist and hate crimes. Inclusion is lost when fake news fuels society with distrust, fear, and extreme emotions that discourage free speech and expression.

The first part of this project will study how deceptive information/fake news affects online users' mental health and well-being. In addition, I will examine how fake news influences racial discrimination on social media. I will employ deep learning (DL) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to quantify the social and psychological impact of fake online information, which is, to my understanding, not being well­explored in the literature. My research outputs will advance the literature on fake news and social media to consolidate EDI principles.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is an unlimited tool that transforms the way of data collection, data analysis, and decision-making in financial services. DL combined with NLP techniques enables promising automatic and real-time information processing that supports Financial Technology (FinTech). In the meantime, decentralized finance (DeFi) emerged in recent years, providing security and trustless benefits to the public in accessing various financial services. Social media is an important channel to promote and publicize this new technology. It is thus of great interest to study how online information and discussions influence DeFi development, especially when DeFI platforms are being hacked and exploited. Lastly, machine learning and text mining methods enable researchers and practitioners to analyze AI and Big Data workforce dynamics in financial industries. With data collected from social networking platforms, we can generate better insights into FinTech talent growth and policy planning. 

The second part of this project will study how social media contribute to Fin Tech development. The first direction focuses on the development of DeFi platforms. Specifically, I will explore how users respond to DeFi hacks and exploits on social media and how these responses shape DeFi development. I will apply sentiment analysis and word embedding approach to extract useful information from posts and comments about DeFi hacks and exploits. I will then use econometric analysis to reveal the causality of social media discussions on the overall health of DeFi and yielding market, realized by the total value locked (TVL). The second direction focuses on the development of FinTech human resources. I will leverage labor information from a professional social networking site to identify AI and Big Data professionals in financial industries. A statistical network model will be formulated, together with textual analytics, to understand what factors drive FinTech talent growth and flow between countries.
